# Test tasks for the position of Python Developer (Scraping), Data engineer in the InterBox company.

## First task

You need to implement a class that will interact with a third-party API: API (https://restcountries.com). The class must receive data from the API then return to the console in tabular form, namely the following data: country name, the name of the capital and a link to a flag image in png format.

My solution to first problem is in the file [countries_api.py](countries_api.py).

## Second task 

You need to create a class that will collect data from a link to the Ebay product page, the data format in which json data should be returned in the test task can be simply displayed in the console or saved to a file. The required data is the name, the link to the photo, the link to the product, the price, the seller, the shipping price. Of course, the more data, the better, but in the context of a test case, it doesn't matter.

My solution to second problem is in the file [ebay_scraper.py](ebay_scraper.py).
